usage: ${BN} <upid>

  Moves archived MD5 S3 objects stored in the Collab storage bucket back into the main project
  folder and marks them for recovery from Glacier.

  Must be run on a Collab instance in the appropriate environment.

  Errors are expected to occur as some objects may not yet have been moved to Glacier and those that
  have can't be moved immediately. Thus, the same set of MD5s might need to be run several hours
  later to finalize the process.

  EXAMPLE:
